Object Loading requires that all objects are in the same order.
If not, Level loading and Savefile Loading will not work properly.
In order to help with object Loading, all objects are given an ID number.
The ID number can not be the same as another objects. This will cause an error when they
are checked by the LevelEditor. The object Id must be assigned by the GameDevs.

There is no save for object loading but instead, a function that will load in all the objects
to a static ArrayList.
All Resources should be loaded into a solitary static class so that when using the level editor,
the resources can be used and assigned easily, and prevent duplication of a single resource.
This is not necessarily a requirement, but it is better for memory management.
